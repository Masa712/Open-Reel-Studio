Follow idiomatic Swift 5 / SwiftUI conventions: keep one view or model type per file, name structs/classes with UpperCamelCase and properties/methods with lowerCamelCase, and prefer immutable `let` bindings unless mutation is required. UI is expressed declaratively with SwiftUI (`NavigationSplitView`, `List`, modifiers), and data models use SwiftData `@Model` classes accessed through `@Environment(\.modelContext)` and `@Query`. Keep view logic lightweight (action helpers such as `addItem`/`deleteItems`) and perform persistence inside `withAnimation` to keep UI updates smooth. Use concise doc comments only when behavior isn’t immediately clear; otherwise rely on self-descriptive property names.
