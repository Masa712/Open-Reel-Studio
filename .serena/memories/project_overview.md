OpenReelStudio is a SwiftUI + SwiftData iOS app scaffold that demonstrates a master-detail list of timestamped `Item` records. `OpenReelStudioApp.swift` sets up a shared `ModelContainer` with a schema containing the SwiftData `@Model` type `Item`, and `ContentView` presents a `NavigationSplitView` list backed by `@Query` plus toolbar actions to insert or delete records. The repository follows the default Xcode layout: `OpenReelStudio/` for app code (App struct, ContentView, SwiftData model, assets), `OpenReelStudioTests/` for asynchronous unit tests built with Apple’s new `Testing` package, and `OpenReelStudioUITests/` (including launch tests) implemented with XCTest. There’s an `.xcodeproj` at the root; no external package managers or third-party dependencies are checked in yet.
